# Path-Finding-Visualizer
A pathfinding visualizer made using python and kivy library. 

Built a Desktop Application for visualizing different Path Finding algorithms using Python, kv lang and Kivy library.

Implemented BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening Search,Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Greedy-Best First Search and A* Algorithm.

## Quick Start Guide
* Click on Path_Finder.exe to start the application.
Refrain from deleting or moving any files.
* Six Algorithms can be chosen:

   1) DFS.
   
   2) BFS (Gives Shortest Path).
   
   3) Iterative Deepening Search
   
   4) Dijkstra's algorithm (Gives Shortest path).
   
   5) Greedy Best First Search.
   
   6) A* Algorithm (Gives Shortest Path).
   
* Movement from one cell to another is in eight directions: up,down,left,right, and 4 diagonals

* To create walls in the the path/grid you can left click or drag the mouse while clicking.

* For the event of a popup:
  Clicking anywhere on the screen other the popup will dismiss it.
  
* Pressing Escape will close the application

* Heuristic Function used for Greedy-Best First Search and A* Algorithm is Eucledian Distance
